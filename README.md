* [ARK Subproject-C](https://github.com/SGIARK/ARK2.0/)
	* ARK Subproject-C is a smart calendar module with a chat-based interface that enables students to manage their schedules using natural language. The interface is built on a modular framework based on LLM tool-calling, allowing the quick integration of future modules (apps) developed. tldr. LLM app store, calendar module "Subproject-C" is our first app
* Cluedumps and IAP Classes
	* SIPB organizes dozens of IAP classes each year on technical topics both serious and fun. During the fall term SIPB also offers a series of Cluedump talks, with a different topic each week. Add yourself to cluedump-announce@mit.edu if you're interested. We're also looking for MIT students to help keep them running smoothly.
* [Courseroad](http://courseroad.mit.edu)

* [delta](https://delta.mit.edu)
	* vhosting is hosting multiple servers from the same machine.  delta is a best-effort vhost server for ad hoc open source services.  the project was started by almonds who figured it would be more convenient than Web Scripts, XVM, or lemonpepper, for quickly spinning up as-needed services, without allocating another IP address.  delta's servers are guided by a principle of statelessness; databases for delta services ought to be from dedicated database servers, like Scripts MySQL.
* [doorpi](https://sipb-door.mit.edu)
	* Doorpi senses when the SIPB Office door is closed & open and displays this information in at https://sipb-door.mit.edu.
* [DormSoup](https://dormsoup.mit.edu/)

* [Lemonpepper](https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SIPBDOCS&title=Lemonpepper)
	* Lemonpepper is a server that has libvirt installed to create virtual machines and a network (bridge) setup that allows the virtual machines to get their own IP addresses. Useful if your project requires a virtual machine with more resources or a more recent operating system than what XVM can easily provide, but if getting a physical server would be overkill.
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.mit.edu)
	* https://mastodon.mit.edu is an instance of the Mastodon federated social networking platform, a part of a Twitter-like communications network of independently-run servers. Anyone on any individual server can communicate with the global ecosystem of federated servers, creating a decentralized social network where no one person or corporation has control of everyoneâs data.
* MIT IdentiBot (SIPB Discord)
	* A catch-all Discord verification bot to allow for various use cases, allowing to verify whether someone is on a specific mailing list, of a given class year, different authentication backends (Touchstone, MIT Admissions website / Slate), and more.
* [MIT Matrix](https://matrix.mit.edu)
	* SIPB Matrix (codename Uplink) is SIPB's effort to bring the Matrix (matrix.org) network to MIT, providing not just another hosted homeserver, but a practical way to communicate that works with the school's existing social dynamics and ecosystem (class group chats, Moira lists, etc), aiming to reduce the usage of proprietary alternatives such as Facebook Messenger, and exclusionary and proprietary alternatives such as iMessage.
* OpenGrades
	* A student-run project that supports crowd-sourced information about classes at MIT since Fall 2021. This platform is limited to students only so you don't have to worry about your professor seeing your review about the class. The platform is just kicking off, so there might be some bugs including incorrect/missing classes.
* Petrock
	* Petrock is a new service that allows your sites to log users in with their MIT account via Touchstone.  Petrock is intended to replace IS&T's now defunct OpenID Connect Pilot and can be an accessible alternative to setting up a Shibboleth server or using CSAIL's Shimmer.  For more details, contact us by email or at SIPB's weekly meetings.
* [SIPB Documentation Project](https://sipb.mit.edu/doc/project/)
	* The SIPB Documentation Project is a project to document in written form the collective knowledge that SIPB members take for granted or use in maintaining services and projects that is not otherwise written down anywhere.
* [SIPB Go](http://sipbgo.mit.edu)
	* MongoDB database for production-level SIPB projects.
* [SIPB Hardware Operations](https://hwops.mit.edu)
	* The HWOPS team maintains the physical server rooms for SIPB: maintaining and upgrading our physical infrastructure, coordinating with IS&T and Facilities, and communicating with other SIPB projects that have or need physical computing resources. We are responsible for the operation of the machine room in W20-575A, as well as for some operations of SIPB's servers in W91. We provide physical server space, server hardware, and server support services to other SIPB projects.
* [SIPB LLMs](https://llms.mit.edu)
	* To provide access and promote understanding of large language models (LLMs) to MIT students, researchers, and instructors.  The LLMs we offer are open-source (permissive use) and self-hosted by SIPB.  Our intention is to implement the project responsibly, informed with the input of as many stakeholders involved as possible.  All project members/roles are encouraged to attend the weekly meetings and contribute to discussion. <3
* [SIPB Project Database](https://sipb-projectdb.scripts.mit.edu)
	* SIPB Project Database is focused on supporting the process of creating and developing projects within SIPB. We want to make it easier for people to join in SIPB projects and for project maintainers to more easily train new people and advertise their projects to the community.   Currently we're responsible for the development of the SIPB project listing website (which you see here), and are looking at expanding our scope to things like: hosting regular project showcases, creating informational workshops about SIPB services, and launching initiatives for supporting onboarding of new members.
* [SIPB Scripts](https://scripts.mit.edu/)
	* Scripts is SIPB's most used service, which hosts thousands of websites for the MIT community. scripts.mit.edu is a Linux/Apache web hosting platform for the MIT community. Any Athena user or group locker can host dynamic web applications written in PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, or any other language, or automatically install blog, wiki, and other software via the quick-start autoinstallers.
* [SIPB Website](http://sipb.mit.edu)
	* Keeping the SIPB website nice-looking and up-to-date
* SIPBlink
	* (WIP!) SIPBlink is an FPGA remote build system, for building, simulating, & uploading digital systems projects to FPGA hardware in the SIPB office or server room, accessible anywhere through a web interface. Our pipeline uses vendor-neutral FOSS steps with fast build times.
* [XVM](https://xvm.mit.edu)
	* XVM offers virtual machines to the MIT community. Start with our three-minute Debian or Ubuntu installer, or install an operating system of your choice. Please e-mail xvm@mit.edu for help using XVM. If you'd like to get involved, please email xvm-team@mit.edu.
